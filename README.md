# Math_Handwriting_OCR
This list contains links to great software tools and libraries and literature related to Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of handwriting, especially on math symbols and formulas.

Contributions are welcome, as is feedback.

## Text Detection
* [Opencv Text Detection](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/20/opencv-text-detection-east-text-detector/): Not 
official implementation, detect text bounding box in aligned(straight) pages.

## Handwriting OCR
* [Handwriting OCR](https://github.com/Breta01/handwriting-ocr): Handwriting text OCR. The preprocess of background 
removal, word detection and normalization might be useful.

## Math OCR
* [MathAI](https://github.com/Roujack/mathAI): Tensorflow, math ocr followed by a character modification by heuristic
rules. A preprocess of segmentation is included. A parser and solver are also included for simple addition, 
subtraction, multiplication and division.

## Not Tested Repos
* [EquationRecognition](https://github.com/LArchCS/Handwritten-Equation-Recognition-Tensorflow): Tensorflow
* [math-formula-recognition](https://github.com/jungomi/math-formula-recognition): Pytorch
* [Mathematical-Handwriting-recognition](https://github.com/Emmarex/Mathematical-Handwriting-recognition)

## Lists
* [Awesome OCR](https://github.com/kba/awesome-ocr): A list of tool, libraries and literature for OCR.
* [NLP-Models-Tensorflow](https://github.com/huseinzol05/NLP-Models-Tensorflow): Gathers machine learning and 
tensorflow deep learning models for NLP problems, code simplify inside Jupyter Notebooks 100%. The OCR inside seems to
be capable of aligned math formulation recognition.
* [optical-character-recognition](https://github.com/topics/optical-character-recognition): With wrapper or implementation
 in js, android, swift, python, java, etc.

## Text OCR
*[CRNN_Tensorflow](https://github.com/MaybeShewill-CV/CRNN_Tensorflow): For aligned pages.
